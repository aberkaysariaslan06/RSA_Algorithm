Ahmet Berkay SARIASLAN


In this assignment, the RSA Algorithm needs to be coded. Unfortunately, I couldn't interface. But thanks to this assignment, I learned how the RSA Algorithm works in the basic sense. It became a real example of encryption, especially in terms of being able to work with large numbers.

The application consists of the following stages :

The user is expected to enter 2 prime numbers. Then the Key values that he can select for the Key Generation operation are sorted. GCD and Totient function are used for key selection. Then the selected "e" value is requested from the user. Since this "e" value can also be selected randomly, it is included as a comment line in the code. The selected "e" value and "n" value are shown to the user. Then the expected "text" input from the user is made. After the user logs in, his message is encrypted.

About BÄ±gInteger : 
I knew that I could use BigInteger for big tricks in this task. However, I used the "UstelMod" function instead of BigInteger. Because I was used to using this mathematical operation in during class and from past Assignments(Assignment2).

I use inntelijidea.
